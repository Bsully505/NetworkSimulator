Introduction
------------

This project is a very simple network simulator that is designed mostly to practice
creating router algorithms.

How to compile/run the program:
------------

1) Compile the code within the folder containing all the source code
2) run the file "App.java"
3) Modify the GUI you are prompted by loading a network and selecting an algorithm, packts per second to be sent and debug level (if you want)
4) Hit the "Run" button!

Breakdown of work
------------

We broke the work down as follows:

Dylan and Jack: Handle the Distance Vector Routing algorithm

Bryan and Henok: Handle the Link State Routing algorithm

Harrison: Float between the two algorithms, acting as a sort of handyman for each

Individual work completed
------------

Jack- With the help of Professor Duncan, created the buildTable method, route method and handling of routing/sending/creating different types of packets (DV packets, ping packets, normal packets)

Dylan- Altered and implemented Bryan and Henok's PingPacket Class/Method to work for Distance Vector Routing.
